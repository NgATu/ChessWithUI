# 2-D Chess for 2 players

## Overview

This is a simple 2D [Chess game][chess-rules] for 2 players using [pygame][pygame-docs] library.

## Requirements

To be able to run this game, you must have these requirements:

- [Python][python-download] **(should be 3.x version)** installed on your computer.
- [Add Python Path to your environment variables.][add-env-path]. If you'd chosen _"Add Python to PATH"_ when you installed Python, you can skip this requirement.

## Installing pygame

To install [pygame][pygame-docs] on your computer, open your Command Prompt _(or Terminal on Mac)_ and type this command: `pip install pygame`

## How to run the game

If you have your own text editor or IDE, you can just run the **main.py** file in your text editor or IDE and enjoy the game ðŸ˜„. Else, check out these steps:

### Run by "clicking the mouse"

- If you're using Windows:
  1. Go to the **Chess folder** that you've downloaded and right click on the **main.py** file.
  2. Choose the option called _"Edit with IDLE"_ and it should bring you to the Python editor,
  3. Press F5 or click 'Run' to start the game.
- If you're on a Mac, I'm not so sure how you can run the game _(because I'm using Windows)_ but you can try [this][python-mac].

### Run by "typing the keyboard"

1. Copy the path to the **Chess folder**
2. Open your Command Prompt on Windows (or Terminal on Mac).
3. Type `cd 'the-path-that-you-copied'` **(Remember to open and close the quotes)**. Example: `cd 'D:\Games\Chess'`
4. Run `python main.py` or in some cases, if it doesn't work, try `python3 main.py`
